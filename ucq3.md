# Introducing Ultimate Chex Quest 3  

## Brutality for Breakfast


Many people have done it before, overlaying Brutal Doom over Chex Quest 3.

However, there doesn't seem to be many 'install guides' on how to eat a complete breakfast. This is your saving grace (although, it's easy)

If you do it right, you should see something like this deliciousness:

What you need:

- [ChexQuest 3](http://www.chucktropolis.com/gamers.htm) from Chucktropolis  
- [Brutal Doom](http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/brutal-doom-v20b-main-file-only) by Seargant Mark IV  
- A clean source port. This is important as the source port that come with ChexQuest 3 is too old to run Brutal. I recommend [Zandronum](http://zandronum.com/download) standalone edition. Important if you despise UAC. Zandronum also has good WAN gaming code.  

How to Install:

1. Unzip that Source Port.

2. Unzip Chex3 and Brutal Doom.

3. Copy chex3.wad and brutalv20b.pk3 into your source port folder.

4. Create a shortcut and move it to desktop.

5. Right Click > Properties > add ````-iwad chex3.wad -file brutalv20b.pk3```` to the end of the target.

6. EAT YOUR BREAKFAST!!!!

Enjoy everybody.

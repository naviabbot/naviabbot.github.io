Hello all, just your friendly writing 'sune here. I've decided to take this blog in a new direction. Instead of being for roleplaying stuff, I decided to use it for gaming things - Easy ways to get games running on Linux, videos, music I found... stuff like that.

As you can see, there profiles are gone, but the posts are still there, as well as my install guides. I hope you enjoy the new direction I aim to take with this site.

Thanks,
Navi

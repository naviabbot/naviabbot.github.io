#Faeya, Goddess of Purity  

Faeya was a woman, until she met [Queenie](https://www.f-list.net/c/goddess%20queenie/). After many years of being a machine for her Queen, she was married and altered. However there was a slip of a green potion and she woke up as a lovely bombshell, sporting glowing pink butterfly wings on her back. Her hair was long as she was tall and violet. A silk collar sat on her neck, which compliments the pink and violet dress that she wears. A pink flower is braided into her hair. Her aura is clean and good, happily contrasting Queenie's dark one. Due to the former situation she was in, she still acts submissive around her wife, although she has forgotten those days.

##Current Scenario

###Rift, Part 2

With the rift closed, Queenie struck a deal with the [Elven Lord Nupper](https://www.f-list.net/c/Nupper), contracting him to rebuild the rift so everyone can be in contact with their Eternal Forms. In exchange, she promised him love from both her and her wife, Faeya. Nupper happily agreed and built the rift, only to find that the universe on the other side was different. As the power flowed forth, it changed the two goddess' forms into that of draenei. Of course, Nupper was happy about it, as he go his sister and her wife as incestuous lovers.

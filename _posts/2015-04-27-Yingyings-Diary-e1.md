Dear Journal,

It has been a few crazy ass months. First, Hana Mojiko, one of the people I somewhat despise, causes trouble like... every day. I know, I know, a princess shouldn't talk about anyone like that, but seriously. Ugh... I'm sorry... I really shouldn't talk like that about someone I _want_ to be friends with. Anywho... Oh yeah! I was coronated about a few months ago as Aelflaed's princess! Pretty exciting stuff, but mom wants me to learn Chinese. I honestly rather learn Gaelic over Chinese, it sounds prettier. And before then, guess who decides to show up a few days before then. None other than my onee-san, Izumi! It's been forever since I last saw her and I had the opportunity to ask for forgiveness for being such a little twerp to her and Fox... oh yeah, he's back too... I'm trying to be nice to him, unlike years past where I was a total drama mama. From my coronation day forward, I pledged to be more mature to all I meet, and I intend to keep it up. Well, after the party, I got my own Super Destroyer Class Flagship, the Persephone! She rides like a dream! Well, I have to get down to court. I think I'll write more on the weekend.  

Her Royal Highness,  
Yingying Mizuru Brenna Aarle Univerba

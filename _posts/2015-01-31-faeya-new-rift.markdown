Shodan never ceases to amaze me with technology. She found a way to let me journal online. Anywho...  

Queenie struck a deal with Nupper. The former rift is gone... can't be a spider like my wife is normally. Nupper began to work on making a new rift. It seems odd, but none-the-less it works. But it doesn't lead to the old alternate universe. I went to rest last night and... woke up really early, feeling those lustfull urges return. I looked at myself in the mirror and found my self as a sexy being. What a rush~ I sorta... kinda humped Queenie in her sleep as she was snuggled next to Nupper. She looks almost like me. Odd. Oh well, Alice and Deep probably know why this happened. I'll go speak with them later.

#Ralcanina Blackclaw  

Ralcanina is one of the daughters of Sin Blackclaw. She wasn't always this way, she was a kitsune by the name of Navicia Abbot. Navi ran into Sin one day and the two got to talking, somehow having the dragoness' magic working against her and altering her into a dragon. 

Ral is a green dragoness of 7' with a green underbelly. The first thing you'd notice would be her EE sized bust, curving towards her child bearing hips and plump rear. Also this mark in black [prosportstickers.com] is displayed right on her crotch, above her pussy, claiming her status as a family member of the Blackclaws. Her face always seems to be in a lustful gaze, especially to those of hermaphroditic status.

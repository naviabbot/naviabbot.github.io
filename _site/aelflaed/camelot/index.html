<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Very long ago, I was known as known as Arthur, son of Pendragon and a dear friend of Merlin. However, there was an incident… right after Excalibur accepted me as her owner. My step-sister, Morgana the Fae… took my Guinevere. I traveled far and wide with my round table of knights, looking for my queen. However, I myself, getting weaker. It was then when my mother and my cousin found me. She claimed to see through my soul and saw unbridled power and the future where I would be queen over Ængland, Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Wales, and what would be known as the British Empire. I accepted her milk and her blood, and was reborn as Aretha. The first thing I did was killed my half-sister and my dear wife… that adulterous bitch. After that, I sat upon the throne and followed my destiny. I now know that I am to rule the entire planet. That is who I am… Your Eternal Empress! </p>

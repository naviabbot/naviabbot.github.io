<p>Meliana Kaimaika was born on Oahu, Hawaii, right in the middle of the island. Blessed with rich tan skin, she is about 6â€™ tall and very athletic. Her parents have an odd shrine to supposedly a deity greater than the ones who formed her island home. Being very skeptical of the being worshipped, she approaches the tiny alter one day and sits in front of it, watching it for this grand goddess to show herself before her to make her believe.</p>

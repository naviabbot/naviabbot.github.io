![Navi](https://static.f-list.net/images/charimage/1447365.jpg "Navi")

Navi is a kitsune, a very curious kitsune with nine tails, who always has a penchant for finding trouble. Usually standing 5' 6", the kitsu has strawberry blond everything, with her tail tips being pure white. She usually dresses in a red and white hakuma as she enjoys clothing from the homeland of japan. Her breasts are about a C cup, usually, though sometimes someone's magic decides to alter her slim, lithe frame to be busty as heck, as seen in the photo below. With a love of life, it is no laughing matter that she devote her womb to bear children. She is a capable mother as well as friend.  
  
##Forms  

###Dragoness  
_Long, long ago, there was a woman who fought nobly for what she thought was right. She was a woman of high stature and was well respected by all, including her opponents. However, there was one person who hated her. While she slept, she was stabbed in the heart by an assassin, thus killing her. She did awake the next morning, however, she was in the body of a kyuubi. She looked around, noticing others around her, being called sister by all she met. It was then she realized that she had ascended because of her murder. She spent many years guiding foxkin in the right direction when she thought it time to live among the mortals. She descended her throne and decided to try something new... something draconic. The change did something to her... it locked away her memories of her life before, however, it didn't stop her magic._  
  
###Temptress  

####Human Past  
_The year was Anno Domini 1326, the place was a small kingdom in Europe. Young Princess Navi Aumenia Amelia Abbot, age 9, was out playing with her friends, the kids of the kingdom her age, when the neighboring kingdom broke it's treaty of peace with her daddy and mommy, destroying her world and loved ones and taking her captive. She was told that she'd be part of the big family, but instead, was treated like a slave. She prayed nightly to her Goddess Aura, who she trusted and obeyed with all her heart. She found wisdom and saw that she was lied to, hardening her hearts to her captors and softening it to her fellow slaves. It was odd though, she was receiving more ridicule than her peers from her captors. She grew angrier and one night, she decided to stay awake in continuous prayer for a release from her prison. However, fatigue, mental abuse, and hunger got to her, causing her to fall asleep._  

####Her Temptress Present and Future  
_Princess Navi woke up on Azoria, the land of her goddess, standing in front of the first temptress, Athenia Aura Fawkes, who greeted her in a tight embrace. She looked up in tears as the temptress hugged her, eyes in wonder as to why she was here. Athenia assured her that the Goddess had plans for her. Navi roamed around the land in wonder and prayed that her destiny would be shown to her. It was then and there that the Goddess gifted her. A pair of wings sprouted from her back, her body changing to her Goddess' whims to that of the second Temptress._  

####Temptress Abilities and Mission  
_Temptresses have 3 born ability. They are given them by the Goddess.  
1* Loving Heart: Her love encompasses all those who are weak and downtrodden. So much to the point where the love manifests itself into gifts.  
2* Just Battler: Her sense of justice makes her and her allies stronger, to the point where the are almost supernatural in form and power.  
3* Weapons of Love: The manifestation of love into items can also go with weapons as she heads into battle for her Goddess Aura, as love is the strongest element known to mortals._  

_Her mission is to help her older sister, Athenia, in any way possible, whether it be acting as second in command, down to pleasing her and accompanying her anywhere Athenia goes, as well as serving her Goddess with her whole heart and soul._  

###Liquid Metal Kyuubi  
_After spending some time with her sister, [Kiana Univerba](https://www.f-list.net/c/kiana%20univerba/), she found herself much different. A liquid metal, black and red kyuubi, who's very substance can be spread to others. If you don't look out, you might join the family._  

###Starlight Kitsune  
_This Christmas, the woman she would hardly bat two lashes at gave her an interesting gift in the form of a Noh mask. Once she put it on, her fur became dark and dotted with starlight and her eyes began to glow. Her power increased to that on a galactic incarnate level._

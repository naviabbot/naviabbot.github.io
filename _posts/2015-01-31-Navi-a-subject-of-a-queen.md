Bountiful day to all who read.  

This happened all yesterday. I met the most exquisite woman. She claimed to be a queen over kitsune. Being skeptical, I tested her knowledge and came to realize that she was from a different land. After hearing her story, I offered my services to her as a bridge to the glorious Inari and my Queen's kingdom. What happened next is magical.  

I grabbed her tail and my bust grew out and my disguise melted away and my tails and paws grew to match. I was stirred into an orgasm that resulted in me being taller... around 7' to be exact. My tails have the power to grant the same changes as my queen. I guess I am her subspecies now... an alien kitsune who only wishes to help expand the kingdom in both Inari and my Queen's names.

Of course, my duties to my niece, Izumi, come first...

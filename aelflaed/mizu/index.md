#Yingying "Mizuru" Univerba

Yingying Univerba is the daughter of [Era Univerba](https://www.f-list.net/c/Era%20Univerba/), the result of Mizuru reuniting with her mother as sort of a way to keep relations with Aelflaed strong with Aloryn. Mizuru decided to attempt to clone the look of her mother, when Era decided to use a bit more blood than the slime predicted. The changes seemed a bit sudden as Mizuru stood there, a younger and less powerful look-alike of Era. The girl asked if she could adopt Era's old name of Yueying, when the maternal figure suggested Yingying instead.
